            My name is Steve Fanega, and I am a Computer Scientist. 
            <br><br>
            I originate from the Philippines, but I grew up in Thailand. 
            Currently, I live in the United States pursuing my one of my dreams; 
            becoming a great and experienced software or web developer. 
            I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics from North Central College. 
            During my time at North Central College, I was Co-President of the International Club, a Resident Assistant, an Orientation Team Leader, and a mentor to International and American first-year students.
            <br><br>
            I worked exclusively for the Web Team and IT Department at North Central College. 
            There I learned more about technology, and had my first glimpse of Web Development. 
            Apart from working, I enjoy sports: mainly basketball and international football. 
            I also enjoy playing the guitar, bass, drums, and singing (though I am bad at it). 
            I especially love learning new things and technologies.
            <br><br>
            My passion for Computer Science was driven by my innate passion to solve problems -- problems that require critical thinking and persistence. 
            I love debugging and develop applications whether on the web or software side. 
            You can find my résumé on this website while also my previous and current projects.

            Currently, I am looking forward to obtaining my Masters in Software Development, and will continue to work for companies in the future.
